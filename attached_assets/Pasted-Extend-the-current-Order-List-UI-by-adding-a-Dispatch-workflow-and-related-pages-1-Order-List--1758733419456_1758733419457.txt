	•	Carrier Mobile (auto-populated but editable).
	•	Rate & Currency (dropdown for USD, CAD, etc).
	•	PO Number (optional field).
	•	Create Dispatch button to finalize.
	•	On submission:
	•	Dispatch entry is created and stored in Dispatch List.
	•	Order status is updated to Dispatched.

4. Tracing & Status Updates

5. UI/UX Polish
	•	Keep the dashboard style consistent with Orders/Customers.
	•	Use tabs or top navigation for Orders, Dispatch, Carriers, Customers, Tracking.
	•	For PDF previews (Invoice / Dispatch Note), use a clean document-style layout with branding space, company details, and order/dispatch metadata.
	•	Ensure all forms auto-fill where possible (carrier info, order info) to reduce manual entry.
