5. UI Consistency & Workflow
	•	Orders Page → Dispatch button (to create dispatch).
	•	Dispatch Page → List of all dispatches, with ability to preview PDF.
	•	Tracking Page → Unified table for tracking all dispatched orders.
	•	Status updates from Tracking Page should sync across Orders + Dispatch instantly
